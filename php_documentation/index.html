<h3>Introduction</h3>
</header>
<p>
  PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development, and also used as a general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
<p>
PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.

  <code>
    &lt;?php
echo "Hello world";<br>

// ... more code<br>

echo "Last statement";<br>

// the script ends here with no PHP closing tag  
  </code>

  <h3>Types</h3></header>
  <p>The type of a variable is not usually set by the programmer; rather, it is decided at runtime by PHP depending on the context in which that variable is used.</p>
  <code>
    &lt;?php<br>
$a_bool = TRUE;   // a boolean<br>
$a_str  = "foo";  // a string<br>
$a_str2 = 'foo';  // a string<br>
$an_int = 12;     // an integer<br><br>

echo gettype($a_bool); // prints out:  boolean<br>
echo gettype($a_str);  // prints out:  string<br><br>

// If this is an integer, increment it by four<br>
if (is_int($an_int)) {<br>
    $an_int += 4;<br>
}<br>
<br>
// If $a_bool is a string, print it out<br>
// (does not print out anything)<br>
if (is_string($a_bool)) {<br>
    echo "String: $a_bool";<br>
}<br>
?>
  </code>

<p>There are ten primitive types</p> 
Scalar:
  <ul>    
    <li>Boolean</li>
    <li>Integer</li>
    <li>Float </li>
    <li>String</li>
  </ul>
Compound:
  <ul>
    <li>Array</li>
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Callable</li>
    <li>Iterable</li>
  </ul>
Special:
  <ul>
    <li>Resource</li>
    <li>NULL</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Variables</h3></header>
  <p>Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.</p>

<p>Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*</p>
<code>
  &lt;?php
$var = 'Bob';<br>
$Var = 'Joe';<br>
echo "$var, $Var";      // outputs "Bob, Joe"<br>

$4site = 'not yet';     // invalid; starts with a number<br>
$_4site = 'not yet';    // valid; starts with an underscore<br>
$täyte = 'mansikka';    // valid; 'ä' is (Extended) ASCII 228. <br>
?>
</code>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="Constants">
  <header>
  <h3>Constants</h3></header>
  <p>A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script (except for magic constants, which aren't actually constants). A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.</p>
  <p>The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thusly: [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*</p>
  <p>It is possible to define() constants with reserved or even invalid names, whose value can (only) be retrieved with constant(). However, doing so is not recommended.</p>
  <code>&lt;?php<br>

// Valid constant names<br>
define("FOO",     "something");<br>
define("FOO2",    "something else");<br>
define("FOO_BAR", "something more");<br>

// Invalid constant names<br>
define("2FOO",    "something");<br>

// This is valid, but should be avoided:<br>
// PHP may one day provide a magical constant<br>
// that will break your script<br>
define("__FOO__", "something"); <br>

?></code>

<section class="main-section" id="Expressions">
  <header>
  <h3>Expressions</h3></header>
  <p>Expressions are the most important building blocks of PHP. In PHP, almost anything you write is an expression. The simplest yet most accurate way to define an expression is "anything that has a value".</p>

<p>The most basic forms of expressions are constants and variables. When you type "$a = 5", you're assigning '5' into $a. '5', obviously, has the value 5, or in other words '5' is an expression with the value of 5 (in this case, '5' is an integer constant).</p>

<p>After this assignment, you'd expect $a's value to be 5 as well, so if you wrote $b = $a, you'd expect it to behave just as if you wrote $b = 5. In other words, $a is an expression with the value of 5 as well. If everything works right, this is exactly what will happen.</p>

<p>Slightly more complex examples for expressions are functions. For instance, consider the following function:</p>
<code>&lt;?php<br>
function foo ()<br>
{<br>
    return 5;<br>
}<br>
?></code>
<p>Assuming you're familiar with the concept of functions (if you're not, take a look at the chapter about functions), you'd assume that typing $c = foo() is essentially just like writing $c = 5, and you're right. Functions are expressions with the value of their return value. Since foo() returns 5, the value of the expression 'foo()' is 5. Usually functions don't just return a static value but compute something.</p>

<p>Of course, values in PHP don't have to be integers, and very often they aren't. PHP supports four scalar value types: integer values, floating point values (float), string values and boolean values (scalar values are values that you can't 'break' into smaller pieces, unlike arrays, for instance). PHP also supports two composite (non-scalar) types: arrays and objects. Each of these value types can be assigned into variables or returned from functions.</p>

<p>PHP takes expressions much further, in the same way many other languages do. PHP is an expression-oriented language, in the sense that almost everything is an expression. Consider the example we've already dealt with, '$a = 5'. It's easy to see that there are two values involved here, the value of the integer constant '5', and the value of $a which is being updated to 5 as well. But the truth is that there's one additional value involved here, and that's the value of the assignment itself. The assignment itself evaluates to the assigned value, in this case 5. In practice, it means that '$a = 5', regardless of what it does, is an expression with the value 5. Thus, writing something like '$b = ($a = 5)' is like writing '$a = 5; $b = 5;' (a semicolon marks the end of a statement). Since assignments are parsed in a right to left order, you can also write '$b = $a = 5'.</p>
